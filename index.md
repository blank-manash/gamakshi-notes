# Technology Notes

### Space technology

Some of the radio isotopes developed
Radio isotope power system a technique of nuclear energy used in space technology
RHU radioisotope heater unit: these are small scale heater unit devices
getting power from radio isotope and mainly attached with smaller
equipments related to space technology. To provide power to small equipments

### Radioisotope thermoelectric generator(RTG)
* Thermocouple device
* During fission new bi-products released. Fissile material plutonium from $U\_{238}$ releases $Pu\_{239}$ weapon graded nuclear weapon.
* Isotopes of Pu used for RTG. 
* Thermocouple device will provide power from Pu isotope will release energy and energy will be given to thermocouple device.
* Heat energy generated in steam will be released to transference of electron i.e. electricity.
* Pu used in electric release that transfers energy from one wall to other.
* Can withstand coldest environment in space and can be deployed for a longer period of time.
* (Very imp) For the first time ISRO satellite centre have released the proposal to develop three faced 100 watt RTG.
 
### Advantages

1) Water Management: All this applications release and absorption of radiation. In same way radiation source in wear can be utilized fore various applications.
    
2) Seepage identification in dams

3) Cases of interconnection of rivers

4) Flow measurement of river

5) Silt movement in ports

6) Archaeological Site Conservation: such sites made of large stones. Our CE cannot detect the faults developed in large stone built historical site. Radiation can directly detect the pores.

Since the time Nuclear technology developed used initially only in
electric energy and bombs but now used almost in all field

## Indian Nuclear Research Program

* Background
* vision
* present status

1950s nuclear research came into being. 50s independence, int this technology in
nascent stage. Dr. Homi jahangir Bhabha associated with int universities
only few scientists have knowledge

He suggested two types of technology Peaceful and Destructive.

Destructive technology very sensitive can be guiding in international relations and electricity generation. Bhabha suggested to use this technology on both lines to have electricity and for internal security (not to indulge in wars). 
Only technology that will restrict others not indulging in war. Bhabha stressing govt to take quick action.
He drafted India'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM in 3 stages and two basis. The RDT available nuclear material natural uranium fissile but India have v less reserves of Uranium <=1%2) in terms of thorium 25% of the whole globe that is very high thorium reserves. Design a program to work towards nuclear dev with limited resources.

Availability of reactor design by 50s technology in starting phases was limited so second point was nuclear reactor design that was available by the decades of 50s. Reactor design and limited uranium two main points of Bhabha

Countries in power were against the plan which would cause destruction. Dr. Bhabha drafted a three step program and asked the to implement but govt faced many challenges. The constituent assembly passed Atomic energy act, 1948 only for peaceful exploration of atomic energy except destructive applications. This act became the basis of Dr Bhabha's research plan.


### Three Stages

#### Stage 1 : Reactor in order to perform chain reaction reactor requires 4 things

1) Nuclear fuel

2) Moderator

3) Coolant

4) Control rods.

Control rods are generally boron and cadmium. 

For both moderator and coolant in first stage he suggested to use heavy water $D_2O$. Practical availability led to the govt. Moderator and coolant as heavy water and pressurized technique PHWR starts the process of fission.

Natural uranium to be used in reaction $U\_{235}$ fissile isotope releases nuclear energy. Whenever a nuclear material undergoes fission a bi-product by transmutation of fertile isotopes known as $Pu\_{239}$ (artificial). Dr. Bhabha called it spent fuel or nuclear waste.
Why? India has limited reserves of uranium so Dr Bhabha keeping this in mind while designing a program to use the limited reserves in such a manner that India would never become a country which would exploit the resources at once on a sustainable management approach. He suggested to use $Pu\_{239}$ as a spent fuel.

#### STAGE 2:

In second stage the fissile isotope left by $U\_235$ i.e. $Pu\_{239}$ should be used as a nuclear fuel. He suggested to use mixed oxides of various nuclear
material as nuclear material present in the form of oxides and present in the reactor. After which take $Pu\_{239}$ left in the first stage and mix with
the already present mixed oxide. $Pu\_{239}$ is a fissile isotope, the moment it dropped starts fission process.

Coolant: heavy water
Moderator: optional

**SECOND STAGE ONLY WHICH DOESN'T REQUIRE MODERATOR**.

Some of $Pu\_{239}$ gets mixed oxide present in the oxides and the process of transmutation leads to the production of more and more $Pu\_{239}$ with mixed oxides so he named the reactor as breeder. Process of transmutation more production than consumption hence breeder. No need to moderate active neutrons hence known as fast breeder reaction (FBR). Vision to have with have ltd uranium reserves India becomes a nuclear power.

Thorium found in very large quantities.

#### Stage 3: Thorium Based Reactor

* To use thorium and make nuclear research plan successful.
* Advanced heavy water reactor because similar to first stage but just advanced.
* Moderator and coolant heavy water
 
Suggested to use natural thorium to be bombarded with a neutron
$Th\_{232}+n\_e$ (in this process releases a fissile isotope) This fissile isotope similar to $U\_{235}$ hence named as $U\_{233}$ (artificial not natural) cyclic process on and on. In terms of practical design this transmutation similar to natural uranium hence also known as advanced heavy water.

Reactor design a challenge in terms of practicability, operability and also operations. GOI started the process of convincing developed world but as there was no plan to allow this power from their hands to others, many also restricted to be used because of destructive purposes ATOMIC ENERGY ACT 1948 objective on lines of peaceful exploration of nuclear energy. GOI started the process in convincing, USA, Canada convinced on the lines that India believed in peaceful exploration. It was convinced by USA that they'll use for peaceful purposes only hence reactor design was given to India by USA.  India became one of the first countries apart from these 5-6 nations to receive reactor design.

Reactor design with operation that Bhabha has proposed got accepted and GOI established AEE atomic energy establishment near Bombay, after that named as Bhabha atomic research centre when Bhabha died. It is most imp research centre in terms of nuclear energy.


| Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3  |
|---------|---------|----------|
| PHWR    | FBR     | TBR/AHWR |


Under AE (Atomic Energy) act 1948 objective peaceful exploration of nuclear energy.  Basis: natural uranium and thorium products and reactor design.  Popular design received by India in 1950 was CANDU Canada Deuterium Natural uranium design uses heavy water as coolant and moderator and natural uranium as natural fuel. Here started the process of reactor development in India.  Countries were convinced only for research purposes.  On the basis of CANDU and stage 1 PHWR they named the reactors as research reactor. For the first time worked on reactor design technology.(PRE ALERT)

_Research reactors year capacity and objective and current affairs important_.

## Research Reactors Of India


| Nuclear Reactor | Year |
|-----------------|------|
| APSARA          | 1956 |
| CIRUS           | 1960 |
| ZERLINA         | 1961 |
| DHRUV           | 1984 |
| PURNIMA         | 1972 |

**First Research Reactor Apsara 1956**

India became the first country in Asia to develop nuclear technology Capacty: 1MW

Objective: production of radioactives for various applications 2018: APSARA renamed as APSARA 'U' and it's capacity developed to 2MW (U for upgraded)

CIRUS (Canada India reactor utility services) developed in 1960 with joint dev of canada and India with capacity 40MW. objective:production of various isotopes

ZERLINA (zero energy reactor for lattice investigation of nuclear asssemblies) 1961: reactor used to study lattice points of uranium and heavy water.

DHRUV 1984 largest source of radioisotopes in India used in various applications of nuclear energy

* PURNIMA1-1972 plutonium fuelled nuclear reactor upgraded to
* PURNIMA 2 as a uranium fueled nr upgraded to 
* PURNIMA 3 as plutonium fuelled nuclear reactor.$Pu\_{239}$ weapon graded , India on the plan of having nuclear tests.  First stage successfully researched and made operational.

By 1971 GOI establishes Reactor research centre (RRC) which was named to Indira Gandhi centre for atomic research in kalpakkam. The second research centre established with the objective to execute second state research program.

Only one success made Proptype Fast breeder reacn (PFBR) named as Kalmakkam mini reactor (KAMINI reactor) made operationalized by 1996. In terms os operationalization only first stage operationalized second demonstrated third stage still research and development.

Only first state made operational, by the time of 1960-1961 GOI opertionalized first stage in terms of electricity generation. There arised a need to take help from UN and by 1948 when GOi presented peaceful exploration and AE act 1962 was ammended by electrical exploration became v important. It was UN who helped India, UN company started working for establishing nuclear power station for
electricity generation in India. So the second reactors came to be known as ENERGY REACTORS. exclusively meant for commercial energy generation and by 1969Tarapur , Maharashtra  became the first nuclear power station in India


| REACTOR     | STATE       |
|-------------|-------------|
| Tarapur     | Maharashtra |
| Rawatbhatta | Rajasthan   |
| Kalpakkam   | Tamil Nadu  |
| Naroura     | UP          |
| Kaiga       | Karnataka   |
| Kakkarpal   | Gujarat     |
| Kundalkulam | Tamil Nadu  |

There started development and till then 7 nuclear power stations established out of which 22 operational and in total releasing `6780 MW` of electricity equivalent to 3% of India's total electricity generation.
India became one of the first country when APSARA received criticality, when this news spread there started development in other countries example china, by 1962 indo china war, India became first country in Asia in achieving technicalities, as India restricted not working beyond nuclear reactors.

After few wars changing IR started working in the manner the nuclear technology started working on nuclear program. Developed countries were also restricting the usage of nuclear technology by others. Nuclear tech till then became very important for international trade and factor for security concern.

Nations started considering that those who are having this technology restrict wars. When India saw nuclear trade and diversification in the field and developed nations started bilateral multilateral relations.

#### Explosion Test

Under Prof Raja Raman India defined explosion test of India not on lines of changing objective but peaceful exploration only but acc to need of hour explosion test is a security and not harmful IT doesn't went well 1974 underground test low kilo ton nuclear fission bomb tested after that GOI named it laughing Budha, Budha-peace they will not use it against the good.

UN made severe sanctions saying that UN helped Indians but they didn't even care to inform. For that purpose NSG was created in 1975 nuclear supplier group to check on entire supply of nuclear. Because it was seen that it was the supply 1974:
* Pokharan made successfully the test 1998 second Pokharan test unlike first had five explosion tests 2 tests physical and nuclear stimulation.
* 5 tests defined India as a nuclear power. India declared itself as a nation successfully developed nuclear weapon state.


India believes in peaceful coexistence to international relations the then PM declared the 4 point doctrine to the international relations and since then nuclear doctrine of India in force.

1) NO FIRST USE: never initiate nuclear technology in warfare in terms of engagement
2) NO USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS AGAINST THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE
3) MIN CREDIBLE DETERRENCE:India will not engage in development of nuclear bombs
4) VOLUNTARILY VIOLATION OF NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY

2) Kundankulam power plant, largest nuclear power plant having installed capacity of 2000MW. In 2017 under general framework agreement (GFA) for the first time in India Russian nuclear company is establishing

    * LIGHT WATER REACTOR(LWR) by June 2021 instead of heavy water light water to be used
    * In Russia this LWR is known  as VVER( voda voda energy reactor)


### Organizations Related to Nuclear Technology in India

AE act, 1948 first basis to execute India's nuclear program. For this purpose AEC (ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION) established with the objective to implement atomic energy act 948 for peaceful exploration of atomic energy in India DAE (DEPARTMENT OF ATOMIC ENERGY) Through a presidential order in 1950, placed under PMO

#### 1954

By 1950 reactor design available, 1954 the first research centre in the name AEE at Trombay, Bombay created research organization to perform research in atomic sciences/basic/nuclear sciences for peaceful organization by 1968 AEE changed to BARC as a dedicated research org of various applications of nuclear technology.1971-1972. 1 RRC reactor research centre established at Kalpakkam responsible for research related to breeders reaction 1984 RRC renamed to IGCAR these two are research reactors of India. AEC ameneded in 1960 objective was commercial generation of electricity. 

#### 1967

Power project engineering division with the objective to establish atomic power stations for the commercial electricity generation.  In accordance with development this organization in 1984 changed to one one board known as nuclear power board (NPB) objective to take the decision for the implementation of nuclear power station in India.
In India in 1987 this board abolished and converted as a public sector unit NPCIL nuclear power corporation of India limited with the objective to start commercial electricity generation with PHRW technology. 1996 second state successfully demonstrated by IGCR, by 1996 when prototype of FBR bult and PSU BHAVINI, 2003 was built bhartiya nabhikya vidyut nigam limited responsible for second stage i.e, FBR for commercial operation. Any sort of radiation language will be disaster on human health. Penetration will be serious hazard and lead to uncontrolled chain reaction.

#### Concerns

1) Safety.
2) Some nations might be indulged in the formation of nuclear bomb.
3) Not to go to non state actors example terrorists.

By the decade of 50s new technology developed serious concerns started on 2 lines UN president came out with proposal called it as 'Atom for peace proposal.
Presented the idea that atomic size should be used only for peaceful exploration otherwise would have disastrous effect in human society.  Advocated for a international agency should work for betterment of all- inspection based agency so that time and again agency can ensure that operations of civilian nuclear reactions is no used in military or bomb development. His proposal was accepted. UN came out with IAEA International atomic energy agency established for atom for peace proposal and UN created it as an inspection agency.

On the very lines of it by 1983: Apsara 2 poornima 5 reactors developed, 3 atomic power station started the work. By this time India has developed peaceful technology, by 1983 GOI on lines of IAEA created safety org BARC,IGCAR,NPCIL and AERB.

AERB-atomic energy regulatory board with the objective as  nuclear safety organization responsible for safety operations for nuclear reactors in India to assure that operation of nuclear reactors in India doesn't have any undue risk to human health and environment.

## Alternative Sources Of Energy/ Non-Conventional Forms Of Energy

Conventional energy sources: Coal petroleum and nuclear fuel since the UK industrialization started for each and everything since tradition known as conventional. All these are sources from fossil fuels and one day entire fuel will get exhausted. In 20th century serious concerns about depletion of fuel. These are known as hydrocarbon economy.

_What will happen to all the boilers/petroleum/nuclear reactors?_

By 1990 S&T research started to address challenges on  two lines shift from conventional to non conventional forms of energy. Start developing technology for non conventional and dependency on conventional will decrease. Economy will have a shift from hydrocarbon to ethanol and methanol/hydrogen.

**Question**: Analyze S and T from a shift of conventional to non conventional.
**Question**: Analyze technological approach from hydrocarbon to hydrogen economy.

Till date the international effort in research and development as presented 5 important NECs.

1) **GAS HYDRATE**
2) **BIOFUEL**
3) **H2 GAS**
4) SHALE GAS
5) CBM

### Gas Hydrate

In the great depth of oceans petroleum products are present so over a long period of time most imp methane gases start seepage to much lower depth.  In the seepage process of methane the seepage of gaseous molecules of methane in the process gets trapped in molecule of water this leads to the formation of ice like crystal structure in depth of ocean. Large bed of these solid crystals present in oceanic bed. These can be used as an alternative of coal.

```
VERY IMPORTANT:

By 1997 GOI started NGHP(National gas hydrate project) to find such reserves in India. Around 2006 some findings and by 2016 in India krishna godavari basin large reserve of basin present. after us Indian has the second highest gas deposit. research came out environmentalists posed a concern, such areas are area related to cold seep ecosystem and it will completely get destroyed. The large solid reserves is also balancing the sea floor There can be sea floor sliding and lead to shift in earth's crust.

UN said technology developments would be made however not yet extracted. Recent research IIT madras, not only methane but also CO2 in atmosphere also forms solid like crystal structure. Research goin on
```

### Bio-fuel
Fuel from living
A tree millions of yr ago seeds of a plant had mineral composition when fossil sources of such gets decomposed is very similar to mineral composition of petroleum products.

Fossil fuel fuels developed from residue sources biofuels developed from living sources. 

1) BIO ALCOHOL
2) BIO DIESEL (FAME- fatty acid methyl ester)


#### Bio-Diesel: Diesel from bio sources.

Plants mineral composition similar to petroleum product till then 400 species of such plants found in the world. Jattrofa is very imp out of them. Take seeds treat with alcohol at a hight temp we will get a product and from the product entire fatty acid needs to be removed. The pure liquid similar to composition to bio diesel and the process is trans esterification.

We can have alternative of diesel with agricultural practices and production same in furnace. Bio diesel .

#### Bio Alcohol

There were many food crops unfit for human consumption,sugarcane mill byproducts, municipal solid waste, such residues should be treated with alcohol at a very high temperature and fatty acids should be removed and the pure liquid ethanol is the matter of interest.

Such type of bio alcohol example ethanol can be used for blending and by blending can result in inc efficiency of conventional products.
Conventional fuel blended will be used for a long period of time and will be alternative. This process is known as fermentation.

India's development: In 2009 GOI came up with national policy on biofuel 2009 with the objective of working on both kinds of biofuels. A biofuel coordination committee setup with the responsibility to oversee the entire development and execution of policies and under the ministry of agriculture national oil seeds and vegetable oil dev board established and under the board jattrofa plantation plant started and 4 lakh hectare areas selected in India. Under the policy decided by the govt to have blending policy for the same. By 2009 planned to have 10% recently PM has instructed to achieve 20% blending by 2025. Shift from hydrocarbon to ethanol. Blending can lead to environment friendly, efficient and cam be direct alt to conventional sources.

Recently GOI came out with new policy on biofuel launched by 208 is in following with the prev policy under this policy on lines of dev of international research biofuels in 3 types:

##### 1G biofuels

1st generation termed in India as basic production bio alcohols.

##### 2G biofuels

2nd generation production bio diesel and the scope of raw material like municipal solid waste also to be treated.

##### 3G biofuels

Production of bio CNG to blend CNG with biofuel i.e. Bio CNG under the policy with the approval of national  biofuel coordination committee a farmer can use surplus food grain production in a cropping age year to divert their food grains in the production of bio alcohol and diesel because in order to achieve the target oil company responsible will be in huge quantity of ethanol, hence farmer can produce ethanol and a supply chain mechanism will be established establishing linkage to farmers, markets and businesses so that tere can be target based blending policy.  Policy envisages additional income to farmers and found a strategic imp in imports in respect to infra development.Shift our economy from conventional to ethanol/ methanol NATIONAL POLICY ON BIOFUEL

### Hydrogen Gas

Most important energy source, $H\_2$ can be made compatible with engines Hydrogen available in plenty but inspite of having advantage $H\_2$ gas has limitations in terms of utilization. $H\_2$ gas very light challenging to store $H\_2$ after production therefore has challenges, on basis of production  $H\_2$ of 4 types

1) Green
2) Grey
3) Brown
4) Blue

Green most important area pf interest can be made from renewable sources blue and grey both can be produced from methane: after production from methane the$CO\_2$  is captured and stored so blue and if left then grey brown hydrogen produced from coal and is v cheap but in terms of pollution emitting large amount of $CO\_2$.

India for first time in India national Hydrogen mission was launched while addressing pm also emphasized that it is the need of hour to shift from hydrocarbon to hydrogen economy. At present in the first phase is to work towards green hydrogen and hydrogen based technology related to various technology sectors.

### Shale Gas

Nearby petroleum deposits gases trapped in rocks are as much efficient as petroleum.
2013 GOI declared NCE but limitation in extraction because it is extracted by a process of hydraulic fracking which requires more amount of water. Water to be pressed with high pressure.

CBM Coal bed methane coal gases trapped in methane declared NCE 1997 coal mined in open cast and underground mines. There are also exposure of methane gases. If CBM can be extracted along with coal.

**Question**: Analyze S&T reaction in NCE and alternative sources.
**Question**: Analyze technological research in a shift from hydrocarbon economy to hydrogen/methanol/economy (focus on policy matters).
